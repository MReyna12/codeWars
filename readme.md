# CodeWars Challenges: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.codewars.com/users/MReyna12" >Visit Here</a> 

A repository filled with codewars challenges (kata). I push three or more solutions five to seven days a week.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript"/>

I start each morning with a cup of coffee and solving a number of Codewars challenges! 

## Optimizations

When feasible, I try to provide more than one solution for each challenge.

## Lessons Learned:

Codewars challenges help me put into practice the concepts I have learned and bolster my critical-thinking skills.

Reviewing solutions also enables me to practice new ways to solve future challenges.
